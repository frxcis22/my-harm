## How It Works

### Search Process
1. User enters search query (e.g., "vendor risk assessment")
2. System searches News API for recent articles
3. AI filters results for cybersecurity relevance
4. Articles are processed and tagged automatically
5. Results are cached for 30 minutes
6. Users can interact with articles immediately

### Engagement System
1. Users like, comment, or share articles
2. Engagement is tracked per article
3. Total engagement = likes + comments + shares
4. Articles with 20+ engagement are promoted to featured
5. Featured articles appear on home page

### Article Processing
- **Title & Content**: Extracted from source
- **Tags**: Automatically generated based on content
- **Relevance Score**: Calculated based on recency, source reputation, and cybersecurity focus
- **Initial Stats**: Random initial likes/comments for social proof
